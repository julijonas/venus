Technical Specifications - Group 15

  - System Architecture (how it was chosen, what it was based on, motivation for changes, also design, history etc.)

	We initially thought about building a robot with 4 powerful kickers that use elastics. This design had a disadvantage of not being  able to kick on different distances, which was essential for the first milestone. Also the dimensions of the robot didn't fit the requirements. 
	After that we agreed on a simpler design.

	Photo!


	Based on?
	Advantage of such design is that it is simple, but the robot can still move fast enough and we could control the power of the kicker. 
 
  - Hardware (components, what the choice was based on, motivation for changes)

	The initial robot had four holonomic wheels. The later design had two main wheels, and one back holonomic wheel, which allowed the robot to turn as well as move forwards/backwards without difficulty. 
	Even though we liked an idea of kicker that uses elastic (this made it more powerful). It was almost impossible to predict the distance. That's why the design that we used for the milestone has a kicker that is powered by the NXT motor and gears.
 
  - Documentation of code (high level! think diagrams!)

	Diagram -> contol.py has commands we send from the console, it sends them to arduino? arduino sends back which command it received and when it's done. Do we need this at this stage?  

  - How we control the robot? (Diagrams, pseudocode?)

	same as before?
	emmm... usb stick? signals, commands.. I totally know what I'm writing about..

  - Vision, communications, planning, strategy, etc. (how they work, what they are based on, motivation for changes)
        - for communication -> list all command that are used

		Copy from user guide...

        - sensors (what data and in which format they provide, how it's read and utilised)

		Rotary Encoder Board
			
			Each motor is connected to the rotary encoder board. This way we get to know how many rotations the motor did since the last query. After every 30ms we query the board and check if we have reached our target value or not. After the value we get gets greater or equal to the target, we stop the motor.
